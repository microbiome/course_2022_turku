(Testing if everything works, remove this...) 

The course takes place on each working day from 9am – 1pm
(CEST). Short breaks will be scheduled between sessions.

The hands-on sessions consists of a set of questions and example
data. Solve the exercises by taking advantage of the online examples
and resources that are pointed out in the study material. There is
often more than one way to solve a given task. It is assumed that you
have already installed the required software. Do not hesitate to ask
support from the course assistants.
